The glob module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according
to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in arbitrary
order. No tilde expansion is done, but *, ?, and character ranges expressed with
[] will be correctly matched. This is done by using the os.scandir() and
fnmatch.fnmatch() functions in concert, and not by actually invoking a subshell
Note that files beginning with a dot (.) can only be matched by patterns that
also start with a dot, unlike fnmatch.fnmatch() or pathlib.Path.glob(). (For
tilde and shell variable expansion, use os.path.expanduser() and
os.path.expandvars().)
Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes… the ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things…they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.
